# XPathSheet
A WIP pathfinder character sheet. This will not natively store ANY data from Paizo, and is therefore fully customizable.

# Some notes
The '<Stat>' class is used as an adjustable number that doesn't rely on other '<Stat>'s (though you can still add in a '<StatAdjust>' to adjust via a stat).
